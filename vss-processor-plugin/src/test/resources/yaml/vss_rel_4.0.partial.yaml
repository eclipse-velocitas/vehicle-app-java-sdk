  comment: Follows https://www.sae.org/news/2019/01/sae-updates-j3016-automated-driving-graphic taxonomy. For SAE levels 3 and 4 the system is required to alert the driver before it will disengage. Level 4 systems are required to reach a safe state even if a driver does not take over. Only level 5 systems are required to not rely on a driver at all. While level 2 systems require the driver to be monitoring the system at all times, many level 2 systems, often termed "level 2.5" systems, do warn the driver shortly before reaching their operational limits, therefore we also support the DISENGAGING state for SAE_2.

Vehicle.AverageSpeed:
  comment: A new trip is considered to start when engine gets enabled (e.g. LowVoltageSystemState in ON or START mode). A trip is considered to end when engine is no longer enabled. The signal may however keep the value of the last trip until a new trip is started. Calculation of average speed may exclude periods when the vehicle for example is not moving or transmission is in neutral.
